So this is a rhythm game, similar to Geometry Dash, FNF, or Piano Tiles, where square notes fall down on keys, and the player is required to press the keys that the notes fall down on. 
I put a lot of my favorite songs here, as well as some other fun songs that everybody will like. Be warned: the levels marked "hard" are in fact, hard! I plan on putting RUSH E in there somewhere. 
Some of the easier tutorial songs were made by myself in Musescore. I also remade many of the other, recognizabe songs, which is to adjust the rhythm. 
Thanks for playing!
